News App - Android Studio This is a simple news app developed during my 2nd semester with my partner Kashish Singh using XML and JavaScript. It displays two articles: Arcanes - Highlights from our college fest. 1st Semester Result Analysis - Overview of the academic performance. The project showcases basic UI design with XML and logic implementation using Java. Our Instagram Page: https://www.instagram.com/organisational_news?igsh=M20xdTVnaWtmZnZy
